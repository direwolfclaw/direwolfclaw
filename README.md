Strange markup language ah!

Trained in an academic setting in unix administration on both the hardware and software sides, and high effieincy scientific computing for computer simulations and analysis, I'm unfamiliar with github. However, I'm quite proficient in c, perl, fortran, and lua as well as other esoteric languages (TCL in particular comes to mind).

I like cats.
